# OSRS-CLAN-HISCORE-RANKER

## WHAT THIS IS
This is a GUI of the ClanHiscores class of the [OSRS-Hiscore-Grabber](https://github.com/WeaverDyl/OSRS-Hiscore-Grabber) project (a GUI for the rest of the project is coming soon or already exists).

This is just a very simple way to rank a list of players (perhaps friends or clan members) by their total level.

## WHY THIS EXISTS
This program was created so that less technical people can now run the same program (with new added features) without knowing how to run or compile a Java file.

This program also introduces some convenient features like easy copying of the results, and the ability to save and load a list of players.

## HOW TO USE
Either type a list of players, load a list of players, or paste a list of players into the "List of Players" text box (making sure each name is seperated by a comma), and click calculate. 

The list can have quotations around each name (just like a String would), the list can have spaces or no spaces as well. As long as the name is there, the program should detect it and calculate the results correctly.
